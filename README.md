## Description

This project challenges players to navigate a helicopter through an obstacle course using physics-based controls and momentum. The game features:

- Helicopter movement using Unity's Rigidbody physics
- Procedural generation of terrain and hazards
- Increasing difficulty as players progress
- Particle effects and smooth camera tracking

## How to Play

### Controls

- `W/S`: Tilt forward/backward  
- `A/D`: Rotate the helicopter  
- `Space`: Gain lift / ascend  
- `Shift`: Boost speed  
- `Esc`: Pause or exit

### Objective

Fly as far as you can without crashing. Navigate through moving and stationary obstacles, balancing lift, speed, and rotation.

## Development

### Built With

- Unity Engine (Version [insert version you used])  
- C# for scripting  
- Unity's physics and particle systems  
- Procedural terrain logic
